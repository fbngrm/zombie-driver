# Implementation
This branch implements the requirements defined in the [task](https://github.com/heetch/FabianG-technical-test/blob/development/REQUIREMENTS.md) description.
Additional functionality is:

* Configuration via environment variables or command-line args
* Instrumentation
* Circuit-breaker
* Docker containers
* Structured logging
* Configurable zombie-driver identification `Predicate/business rules`

# Overview

This document is organized in two sections:

* Documentation - describes setup and usage
* Architecture - describes the design and architecture approach

# Documentation

### Setup
This section assumes there is a go, docker, make and git installation available on the system.

To check your installation, run:

    go version
    docker version
    make --version
    git version


Fetch the repo from GitHub:


    git clone git@github.com:heetch/FabianG-technical-test.git
    cd FabianG-technical-test
    go get


##### Dependency management
For handling dependencies, go modules are used.
This requires to have a go version > 1.11 installed and setting `GO111MODULE=1`.
If the go version is >= 1.13, modules are enabled by default.
There might be steps required to access private repositories.
If you have problems setting up or building the project which are related to modules, please consider reading up the [documentation](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
If this does not solve the issue please open an issue here.

### Usage
Makefiles are provided which should be used to test, build and run the services separately or all at once.
The services and backing services are started in a docker container.
The configuration resides in the [docker-compose](https://github.com/heetch/FabianG-technical-test/blob/development/docker-compose.yaml) file.
The Dockerfiles used to build images are located in the project root.


###### Build
Builds will are located in the `/bin` sub-directory of each service. Binaries use the latest git commit hash or tag as a version.


    make all # builds all services


###### Run
Services are intended to be ran in a docker container.


    make up # builds docker containers and runs all services and backing services


###### Tests
There are several targets available to run tests.


    make test # runs tests for all services
    make test-cover # creates coverage profiles for all services
    make test-race # tests services for race conditions


###### Lint
There is a lint target which runs [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) in a docker container.


    make lint


###### Service level
Except for `up`, all targets are available on a service level.
Run the make command from the respective service directory or use the `-C` argument.


    make -C <service_name> all # builds <service_name>


### Configuration
Services can be configured by parameters or environment variables.
For configuring the services via environment variables use the docker-compose file.
Alternatively, provide arguments to the command directly.

#### Logging
The current setup uses a human friendly logging format. Service loggers attach the service name and build version to the log output.

#### Bugs
Setting logger on NSQ producers and consumers.
The logger used in the project does not implement the required interface to be used in NSQ.
Thus, logs are a bit polluted.

# Architecture
I mostly followed the go [conventions](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) and [proverbs](https://go-proverbs.github.io/) as well as the [12 Factor-App](https://12factor.net/) principles.

The interfaces are kept small to bigger the abstraction.
Variable names are short when they are used close to their declaration.
They are more meaningful if they are used outside the scope they were defined.
Errors are used as values.

Furthermore, I followed the dependency injection and fail early approach, with very few exceptions.
Components are provided all dependencies they need during instantiation.
The result is either a functioning instance or an error.
On application start-up,  an error results in termination.
Runtime errors do not lead to a crash or panic.

Configuration is injected at start-up.

Termination signals lead to a graceful shutdown.
Meaning, all servers and handlers stop accepting new requests, process their current workload and shutdown.
Though, there is a configurable shutdown timeout, which may prevent this.

### Configuration
The configuration of the services, e.g. circuit-breaker rules, and backing services (NSQ, redis) is not at all not production ready.
The current state should be considered as a prototype to solve the coding challenge.

### Instrumentation
Only response time metrics and redis method calls are collected as an example of instrumentation.
In a real world application the runtime behavior would be monitored in a more detailed way.
Prometheus is used for aggregating the metrics, which are provided by an HTTP handler to be scraped by an prometheus collector.
A graceful shutdown of the server ensures that the metrics will be scraped eventually by checking against an access counter.
Though, the shutdown timeout prevents this from being guaranteed.

### Tests
There are unit tests for core functionality, things expected to break and for edge/error cases.
In general I think testing on package boundaries as well as core functionality internally is a better approach than just aiming for a certain percentage of coverage.
Regarding a few error cases, test coverage should be increased though.

Tests that require and NSQ server use a helper script to start and shutdown a docker instance in the background but stream logs to a file to not obfuscate test log.

##### Testdata
There is a testdata directory which provides simple real world sample data used in most tests.

##### Redis
Since there are two redis commands used only, I implemented an interface to provide a simple mock in tests.
This requires an extra layer of abstraction which could be avoided using a redis mock library.
If there will be more commands used, I would prefer to add a dependency and remove the abstraction.

### Dependencies
In general, the code is written in a way to use as few dependencies as possible and make use of the standard library whenever possible.
This applies also for tests, where no external libraries are used since they mostly do not provide significant advantages but may obfuscate clear readability.
This especially applies to BDD (Behavioral Driven Design/Development) test libraries, which often introduce needless indirection and conceptual overhead.

##### Shared libraries
There are a few shared libraries at the project root which are used in all three services.
I would tend to move each service to an own repo and copy over the library code along.
Although, using go modules with visioning, providing the ability to update incrementally, makes it easier to handle shared libraries now.

### Circuit-breaker
The circuit-breaker should additionally be implemented as middleware for HTTP handlers.
This requires a refactoring of the middleware which is out-of-scope during this test.
Note, that is no circuit-breaker applied in the [gateway HTTP proxy handler](https://github.com/heetch/FabianG-technical-test/blob/development/gateway/server/handler.go#L68-L78).

### (Zombie) Workflow
Since I am the only contributor (except for initial commits) and there will be a single PR, I followed a rather "pragmatic" git workflow.
I implemented features in separate branches in the beginning but stopped to continue this at some point.
I am aware that this flow is not ideal for teamwork.

### Todo
* Fix NSQ logging
* Fix driver-location URL in zombie-driver config (avoid format string)
* Prometheus scraper + dashboard
* HTTPS (gateway, NSQ)
* Authentication/sessions
* Load testing
* Tracing
* Rewrite middleware
* Custom proxy/circuit-breaker
* Benchmarks
* Resilience
* Load-balancer
